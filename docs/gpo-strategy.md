# Group Policy Strategy

## Overview
Group Policy is used to enforce security settings, standardize workstation behavior, and control access across the domain.

## GPO Design Approach
- Policies are separated by function
- GPOs are scoped to Organizational Units
- Default Domain Policy is reserved for authentication settings
