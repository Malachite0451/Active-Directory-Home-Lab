# Active Directory Home Lab

## Overview
This project is a fully functional Active Directory home lab designed to simulate a real-world corporate IT environment. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with Windows Server administration, identity management, Group Policy, file services, networking fundamentals, and remote desktop support workflows. The environment includes a domain controller providing Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services, multiple domain-joined workstations, and a dedicated file server. Access is managed using role-based security groups following the principle of least privilege. Group Policy is used extensively to enforce security settings, map network drives, control Remote Desktop access, and standardize workstation behavior. A remote support workflow was implemented to mirror real desktop support operations. Support users can securely connect to workstations using Remote Desktop, review system and application logs via delegated Event Viewer access, and troubleshoot common user issues without requiring administrative privileges or server access.
