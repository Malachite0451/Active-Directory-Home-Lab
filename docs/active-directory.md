# Active Directory Design

## Overview
This document describes the Active Directory structure used in the lab, including Organizational Units, users, and security groups.

## OU Structure
- Department-based OUs are used for users
- Separate OUs exist for workstations and servers
- OU design allows targeted Group Policy application



## Security Groups
- Security groups represent job roles
- Permissions are assigned to groups, not individual users
